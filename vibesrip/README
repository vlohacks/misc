Various attempts to rip mods from vibes musicdisk
effort reaches from several lame attempts in the 90ies
(check the BASIC code :-) ) until 2013 - of course
with large gaps

progress so far:

- DONE: headerdata scrambled xor 71
  (revealed by riprot.c)

- DONE: sampledata scrambled xor i++ where i starts at 0 and wraps
  at 256 (unsigned char) or aka 
  mov cx, [SAMPLEDATASIZE]
  xor al, al
  loop:
  xor bl, al
  inc al
  dec cx
  jnz loop
  === UPDATE ===
  also the data is stored unsigend 8 bit pcm, standard spec for
  MODs is signed 8 bit pcm data

- DONE: patterndata somehow packed, reformatted - noticeable the  
  pattern "TTAP" which reappears severat time through the 
  data (reverse(TTAP) = PATT = PATTern?)
  data shows 4x4 regularities on 4chn (M.K.) MOD, but sometimes
  shifted by one byte
  ==== UPDATE ====
  Data is run length encoded: 
  * a 0xff means RLE starts here 
  * if the following byte is > 0 this is the count of the data
  * in this case the next byte is the data repated count times
  * if the count byte is 0, a *real* 0xff gets written
