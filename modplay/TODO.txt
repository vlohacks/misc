Fixes:
- player: Implement missing effects (still some exotic shit missing... maybe 
  i'll leave them out...)
- player: fix little noises on looping points of samples (bug in interpolation?) 
  (overture.mod)
- loader_mod: fix FLT8 loading
- Effects: Vibrato still sounds weird in some mods which run faster than speed 6. 
  Documentation (FMODDOC) says vibrato state should reset every new row, so I 
  implemented it this way, but I don't think that's true. Maybe it must only 
  reset with NEW NOTE.
- Dynamic mapping of effect color in terminal output depending on module type
  (s3m, mod...)

Features:

- s3m Effects
- Graphical (QT?) UI

- DONE ???????? player: Implement Panning
- DONE ???????? player: Remove hardcoded 0x3 (Note Portamento exception) from player code
- DONE ???????? player: reset frequency after vibrato? (some mods sound weird: TODO examples)
