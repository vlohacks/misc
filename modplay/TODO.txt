Fixes:
- effects_mod: Implement missing effects (still some exotic shit missing... maybe 
  i'll leave them out...)
- player: fix little noises on looping points of samples (bug in interpolation?) 
  (overture.mod)
- loader_mod: fix FLT8 loading (have no example file currently...)
- UI: Dynamic mapping of effect color in terminal output depending on module type
  (s3m, mod...)
- UI: Annotation of channel numbers in pattern view and column names in channel view
- UI: Better color scheme (grey out stuff which has no information) 
- UI: do not segfault if there's not enough room to draw specific window :-)
    => Overhaul complete Curses UI which is a fucking mess currently


Features:
- UI: Overhaul window handling in ncurses, implement small tiling/overlay window manager
- UI: different narrow vs. nice pattern view styles
- UI: implement platform transparent handling of terminal resizing signalling
- UI: in-player playlist management and file browser
- UI: platform transparent (ncurses/unix <=> pdcurses/windows) key mappings
- UI: Sample view!!
- UI: scrolling of views (channel view: horizontally, channel and sample view vertically)
- FORMAT: Impulse Tracker (.IT) ... hardest piece of work ;-)
- FORMAT: Fast Tracker 2 (.XM)
- FORMAT: (.PSM) (Jazz JackRabbit ;-))
- FORMAT: Oktalyzer (.OKT) => has weird effects..

Window Layout (posibility to turn on/off any window):

Done:
- DONE 20150825 Check vibrato effects again vs ST3 (still "feels" weird in some S3Ms)
	* Shadow of Illusion/alone.s3m
- DONE 201507?? Effects: Vibrato still sounds weird in some mods which run faster than speed 6. 
  Documentation (FMODDOC) says vibrato state should reset every new row, so I 
  implemented it this way, but I don't think that's true. Maybe it must only 
  reset with NEW NOTE. => Hopefully fixed now
- DONE 201401?? s3m Effects
- DONE 20131226 loader: S3M Loader
- DONE 20131220 module: get rid of periods in module, only use indices
- DONE 20130706 player: Fix pattern loop when occuring in 2 colums (darkwond.mod getting into endless loop)
- DONE ???????? player: Implement Panning
- DONE ???????? player: Remove hardcoded 0x3 (Note Portamento exception) from player code
- DONE ???????? player: reset frequency after vibrato? (some mods sound weird: TODO examples)
